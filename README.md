An OpenCL/OpenGL implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written and implemented by Stephen Newman. Some small segments of code are from various online sources, which are linked at the relevant points.

This code is distributed entirely as-is. No guarantees are made as to its function or effects, and the effects of its use are solely the responsibility of the user.

The program was developed and tested in Ubuntu 18.04. It may be compatible with Windows, but it probably isn't. The changes to fix it, however, should be minor.
